lyx-tester:
- Test again on Amazon EC2. Here is some old commented out code:
# The Amazon EC2 basic (400 MB of RAM) fails at linking stage if this flag is
# on when building and LyX will run faster without debug symbols anyway.
# Alternative:
#     You could leave this alone and change -DLYX_RELEASE to 'ON'. AWS will
#     also be able to build in this case. However, I think it's better to have
#     ASSERTs turned on.
#sed -i 's/-DLYX_DEBUG=ON/-DLYX_DEBUG=OFF/' lyxbuild >&2 \
#    || { echo "ERROR: could not replace with sed" >&2; mainRet=1 ;}

- Options:
  argument for autotests
  logdir into an option
  runTests (lyx-tester might want to be used just to install
        all prereqs and prep for tests or a complete system)
  numCores

ssh-lyx-tester:
# We might want to transfer a key in order to test feature branches
# scp -i "${key}" id_rsa ubuntu@${server}:/home/ubuntu/.ssh/ >/dev/null 2>&1 \
#     || { echo "ERROR: could not scp the ssh key over." >&2; exit 1; }
