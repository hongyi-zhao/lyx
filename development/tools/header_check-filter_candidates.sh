# Narrow down possible candidates for include removal in .cpp files.
# The main idea here is that the removal candidates in header_check.sh.log
# are real only when included in the translation unit just once.
# If included twice or more the removal candidacy is just effect of indirect
# include from other header.

# To detect this we just insert unconditionally unique declaration ("trap") 
# into each header file and look on the result of preprocessor, which will
# be stored now stored in .o (instead of usual compiled binary content).
# Output are only the cases where trap is found exactly once in a given .o.

# To be run on the results of header_check.sh script.
# Careful, the tree will be left in mess after running this
# (changed header and (git untracked) Makefiles...).
